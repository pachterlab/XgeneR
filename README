This repository includes code to run analysis of _cis_ and _trans_ regulatory differences between homozygous strains using RNAseq data from parents of both strains and their hybrid crosses, and to visualize the results. It requires that replicates are available. 

Source code is in `R/`, while example vignettes can be found for single condition or multiple condition regulation in `vignettes/`.  

The preprint "Estimating cis and trans contributions to differences in gene regulation" [Hallgrímsdóttir et al. 2024] describes the theory behind the model, statistical tests, and visualization.  

It can be installed in R:

<code> devtools::install_github("pachterlab/XgeneR") </code>.
