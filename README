#XgeneR

This repository contains the code written by Maria Carilli to run analysis of _cis_ and _trans_ regulatory differences between homozygous strains using RNA-seq data from parents of both strains and their hybrid crosses, as well as code to visualize the results. It requires that replicates are available. 

Source code is in `R/`, while example vignettes can be found for single condition or multiple condition regulation in `vignettes/`.  

The preprint "Estimating cis and trans contributions to differences in gene regulation" [Hallgrímsdóttir et al. 2024] describes the theory behind the model, statistical tests, and visualization.  

XgeneR can be installed in R with the command

<code> devtools::install_github("pachterlab/XgeneR") </code>.
